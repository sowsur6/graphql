the objective is to learn graphQL language by creaqting our own profile page
your profile should contain at least 3 sections of contents
it is mandatory to use graphs for statistical information
start with creating a profile UI to see all our information
information/data is present on the graphQL endpoint where you can query it
I have to do at least two different statistic graphs for the data given
graphs must be done using SVG

Here are some possible combinations for the creation of the graphs:

    XP earned in a time period (progress over time)
    Levels over time
    XP earned by project
    Audit ratio
    Projects PASS and FAIL ratio
    Piscine (JS/Go) stats
        PASS and FAIL ratio
        Attempts for each exercise

Besides the creation of your own profile you will have to host it! There are several places where you can host your profile,for example: github-pages, netlify and so on. You are free to choose the hosting place.
